**Developing Entity Relationship Diagram**

A company has several departments. Each department has a supervisor and
at least one employee. Employees must be assigned to at least one, but
possibly more departments. At least one employee is assigned to a project,
but an employee may be on vacation and not assigned to any projects. The
important data fields are the names of the departments, projects, supervisors
and employees, as well as the supervisor and employee number and a unique
project number.
